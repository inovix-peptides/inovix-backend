 * Safety net for the redirect-payment race: a customer can pay at Mollie and

 * the redirect), leaving a paid Mollie payment with no Inovix order. The
 * browser is the only thing that calls cart.complete, so without this the order
 * is lost even though the money was taken.
 *
 * Every tick this polls the broker for each recent, not-yet-completed broker
 * cart and completes only the ones the broker reports as paid. Polling first
 * (instead of letting completeCartWorkflow's authorize step reject unpaid
 * carts) keeps the logs clean | otherwise every abandoned checkout would emit
 * an "authorize payment session" error on every tick.
 *
 * completeCartWorkflow is idempotent (Medusa returns the existing order if the
 * browser already completed the cart), so this never duplicates an order or
 * races the return, and it fires the normal order-placed flow incl. the
 * confirmation email. Nothing here is sent to Mollie | the broker poll only
 * carries the opaque ref.
